   - âœ… Created `RBAC-Staging-Deployment-Guide.md` with detailed instructions for staging deployment
   - âœ… Created `RBAC-Production-Deployment-Guide.md` with detailed instructions for production deployment
5. âœ… Create user training and onboarding materials
   - âœ… Created `RBAC-User-Training-Guide.md` with role-specific workflows and FAQ
   - âœ… Created `RBAC-Implementation-Final-Report.md` for stakeholder communication

### Deployment
1. âœ… Created deployment scripts
   - âœ… `deploy-staging.sh`/`deploy-staging.ps1` - Scripts for deploying to staging environment
   - âœ… `deploy-production.sh`/`deploy-production.ps1` - Scripts for deploying to production
2. âœ… Added PowerShell scripts for Windows deployment
3. âœ… Added staging environment configuration
4. âœ… Added production environment configuration
5. âœ… Created database management scripts
   - âœ… `backup-database.js` - Script for backing up the database
   - âœ… `restore-database.js` - Script for restoring from backups

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Complete the remaining backend route updates
2. âœ… Update the remaining frontend components
3. âœ… Test the complete RBAC implementation
4. âœ… Create comprehensive documentation
5. âœ… Create deployment scripts
6. ðŸ”² Deploy to staging environment for verification
   - Use appropriate script based on environment (`deploy-staging.sh` for Linux/Mac, `deploy-staging.ps1` for Windows)
   - Verify middleware and token handling
   - Follow the deployment checklist
   - Create database backup before deployment
   - Follow the detailed steps in `RBAC-Staging-Deployment-Guide.md`
7. ðŸ”² Deploy to production with monitoring for any issues
   - Once staging is verified, use production deployment script
   - Follow the deployment checklist
   - Create database backup before deployment
   - Monitor for any issues post-deployment
   - Follow the detailed steps in `RBAC-Production-Deployment-Guide.md`
8. ðŸ”² Conduct user training sessions
   - Share the `RBAC-User-Training-Guide.md` with end users
   - Schedule training sessions for each user role
   - Collect feedback and address questions

## Test Coverage Summary
The test suite now includes comprehensive tests for both backend and frontend RBAC implementation:

### Backend Tests
- Integration tests for role-based access control on all protected routes
- Tests for different user roles (admin, tech, purchasing) and their access permissions
- Verification of middleware functioning for different API endpoints
- Unit tests for authentication and role authorization middleware
- JWT token validation tests

### Frontend Tests
- Component tests verifying proper rendering of UI elements based on permissions
- Tests for conditional elements like buttons and action items
- Mock authentication context to simulate different user roles and permissions

## Documentation Summary
The RBAC implementation is now fully documented:

1. **API Documentation** - Detailed documentation of API endpoints and their permission requirements
2. **User Guide** - Clear explanation of role capabilities for end users
3. **Developer Guide** - Comprehensive guide for developers to understand, maintain, and extend the RBAC system
4. **Deployment Checklist** - Detailed checklist for deployment procedures and verification
5. **Deployment Guides** - Step-by-step instructions for staging and production deployment
6. **User Training Guide** - Role-specific training materials for end users
7. **Final Report** - Comprehensive summary of the RBAC implementation for stakeholders

## Deployment Plan
The deployment will proceed in two phases:

1. **Staging Deployment**
   - Backup the staging database before deployment
   - Deploy to staging environment using appropriate deployment script
   - Verify RBAC implementation with different user roles
   - Test all secured routes and UI components
   - Confirm error handling works as expected
   - Verify JWT token handling and user authorization
   - Follow the comprehensive deployment checklist and guide

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Once verified in staging, create a full backup of the production database
   - Deploy to production using the appropriate deployment script 
   - Monitor for any issues post-deployment
   - Have rollback plan in place in case of unexpected issues
   - Follow the comprehensive deployment checklist and guide
   - Implement the monitoring plan outlined in the production deployment guide
