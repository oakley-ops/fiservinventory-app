# RBAC Implementation Deployment Checklist

This checklist helps ensure a smooth deployment of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation to staging and production environments.

## Pre-Deployment Tasks

### Code Review
- [ ] All RBAC middleware components have been implemented and tested
- [ ] JWT token now includes user role information
- [ ] All routes have been protected with appropriate role authorization
- [ ] Frontend components render conditionally based on user permissions
- [ ] All tests are passing

### Documentation Review
- [ ] API documentation updated with RBAC requirements
- [ ] User documentation for role capabilities completed
- [ ] Developer guide for RBAC extension and maintenance completed

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Staging environment variables configured (`.env.staging`)
- [ ] Production environment variables prepared but secured
- [ ] JWT secrets properly configured for each environment
- [ ] Database users and permissions properly set up

## Staging Deployment

### Preparation
- [ ] Database backup of staging environment created
- [ ] Required dependencies installed
- [ ] Deployment script permissions verified

### Deployment Steps
- [ ] Run backend tests (`npm test`)
- [ ] Run frontend tests (`npm test -- --watchAll=false`)
- [ ] Build frontend for production
- [ ] Run database migrations on staging
- [ ] Deploy backend to staging server
- [ ] Deploy frontend to staging server
- [ ] Verify backend health check
- [ ] Verify frontend is accessible

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Test login with admin account
  - [ ] Verify full access to all features
  - [ ] Verify ability to manage users and roles
  
- [ ] Test login with tech account
  - [ ] Verify appropriate limited access
  - [ ] Verify protected routes return 403 when accessed directly
  
- [ ] Test login with purchasing account
  - [ ] Verify appropriate feature access
  - [ ] Verify UI renders correctly with role-specific elements

- [ ] Verify token expiration handling
- [ ] Verify unauthorized access handling
- [ ] Test concurrency with multiple users of different roles

## Production Deployment

### Preparation
- [ ] Staging environment fully verified
- [ ] Production database backup created
- [ ] Deployment approvals obtained from stakeholders
- [ ] Maintenance window communicated to users

### Deployment Steps
- [ ] Run full test suite again
- [ ] Build frontend for production
- [ ] Run database migrations on production
- [ ] Deploy backend to production server
- [ ] Deploy frontend to production server
- [ ] Verify backend health check
- [ ] Verify frontend is accessible

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Verify all roles function as expected in production
- [ ] Verify system performance with RBAC enabled
- [ ] Monitor error logs for any RBAC-related issues
- [ ] Verify third-party integrations continue to work

## Rollback Plan

### Triggers for Rollback
- [ ] Critical authentication failures affecting multiple users
- [ ] Widespread 401/403 errors that prevent core functionality
- [ ] Significant performance degradation

### Rollback Steps
1. Restore previous backend version
2. Restore previous frontend version
3. Restore database from pre-deployment backup if necessary
4. Verify system functionality after rollback
5. Notify users once system is operational

## Final Verification

- [ ] All user roles can perform their designated functions
- [ ] JWT token handling functions correctly
- [ ] Role-based UI rendering works as expected
- [ ] No excessive 401/403 errors in logs
- [ ] System performance remains within acceptable parameters

## Sign-Off

- [ ] Development team sign-off
- [ ] QA team sign-off
- [ ] System administrator sign-off
- [ ] Product owner sign-off
